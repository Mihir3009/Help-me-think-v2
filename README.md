# Help-Me-Think-v2.0

This repository maintains a community effort to create large collection of tasks which needs customization, thinking or expertise (i.e., hard for average humans to do). Any contributor with sufficient work in creating tasks can be the co-author in our v2.0 effort (please check How to Contribute). We welcome external collaboration or suggestions to make this dataset better and bigger! ðŸ™Œ

## Background

This collection of tasks is the extension of the work done in [HELP ME THINK - v1.0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08232.pdf).

### Objective

**TLDR**; Controlling the text generated by language models and customizing the content has been a long-standing challenge. Existing prompting techniques proposed in pursuit of providing control are task-specific and lack generality; this provides overwhelming choices for non-expert users to find a suitable method for their task. The effort associated with those techniques, such as in writing examples, explanations, instructions, etc. further limits their adoption among non-expert users. To allivate this issue, we propose [HELP ME THINK](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08232.pdf) prompting technique which allows non-expert user to use Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 s by asking a set of relevant questions and leveraging user answers to execute the task.

### Any empirical evidence that this might be true?

Our [recent study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08232.pdf) shows (across 63 tasks) that this prompting technique is effective in performing tasks that requires expert human knowledge or customization.

            "Output": "Hello, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I am thrilled to be here to talk about my new film, 'Last Samurai'. As many of you know, the film is set in Japan during the late 1800s, and revolves around a group of samurai who fight to keep their way of life alive as the world around them changes. I think this film will be very popular because it is such a visually stunning film and because it explores the true samurai code. I play the main character, Kenshinn, in the film. Kenshinn is a skilled warrior who has to grapple with his own morality. I enjoyed playing this character because he is so conflicted and there are so many different aspects to him. The final scene in the film was the most challenging for me to film. Kenshinn is struggling with his decision to kill or not kill his target. This was a very emotional scene and it was difficult to get into the mindset of my character. Overall, I am very proud of this film and I think it will be very successful. I would like to thank everyone who worked on this film with me. I could not have done it without you. Now, I would like to speak about my next project. I am currently working on a film called 'The Last Samurai 2'. It is a sequel to 'Last Samurai' and it picks up where the first film left off. I am really excited to be a part of this project and I think fans of the first film will love it. I want to thank you all again for your time. I hope you enjoy the film."

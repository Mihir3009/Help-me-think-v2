                    "Answer": "The basic units of biochemistry are atoms, molecules, and cells. Atoms are the smallest units of matter and are the building blocks of molecules. Molecules are composed of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Cells are the basic units of life and are the smallest units that can carry out all the functions of life."

                    "Answer": "The major types of biomolecules are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Carbohydrates are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Lipids are composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Proteins are composed of amino acids. Nucleic acids are composed of nucleotides."

                    "Answer": "The major types of regulatory mechanisms are negative feedback and positive feedback. Negative feedback is a process in which a change in a variable triggers a response that reverses the original change. Positive feedback is a process in which a change in a variable triggers a response that amplifies the original change."

            "Output": "Yes. Biochemistry is the study of the chemical processes that occur in living organisms. In terms of programming, biochemistry can be thought of as the study of the algorithms that govern the behavior of cells and biomolecules. The basic units of biochemistry are atoms, molecules, and cells. Atoms are the smallest units of matter and are the building blocks of molecules. Molecules are composed of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. Cells are the basic units of life and are the smallest units that can carry out all the functions of life. In terms of programming, cells can be thought of as objects and biomolecules can be thought of as data structures. The basic functions of biomolecules are to provide structure, to catalyze reactions, to store energy, and to carry information. In terms of programming, these functions can be thought of as the methods that objects use to interact with each other. The major types of cells are prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic cells are the simplest type of cell and do not have a nucleus. Eukaryotic cells are more complex and have a nucleus. In terms of programming, prokaryotic cells can be thought of as simple objects and eukaryotic cells can be thought of as complex objects."

Solar panels can also be used to power homes and businesses. It is very sparsley populated so there is a lot of room to install solar panels. The climate is also very conducive to solar power with high average temperatures and lots of sunlight exposure. It has very high cosumption of energy and high carbon dioxide emissions so it would be beneficial to the environment to switch to solar power."

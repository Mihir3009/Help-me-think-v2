In this case, the desired reaction is the neutralization of the acid in the analyte solution by the base in the titrant solution. The point at which the desired reaction occurs is called the endpoint. \nTo perform the titration, 10 mL of the titrant solution and 10 mL of the analyte solution are placed in a beaker. The beaker is then placed on a magnetic stirrer, and the stirrer is turned on. The titrant solution is slowly added to the analyte solution, and the mixture is stirred constantly. The endpoint is reached when the pH of the mixture is 7.0. At this point, the volume of titrant solution added should be noted. The concentration of the analyte solution can then be calculated using the following equation:\nConcentration of analyte = (Volume of titrant added)(Concentration of titrant) / (Volume of analyte) \n In this case, the expected concentration of the analyte solution after titration is 0.01 M."

                    "Question": "How do you determine the size and shape of a quadcopter's frame?",
                    "Answer": "The size and shape of a quadcopter's frame is primarily determined by the size and shape of its propellers. The frame must be large enough to accommodate the propellers and have enough space between them to avoid interference. It should also be strong enough to support the weight of the quadcopter and its components."

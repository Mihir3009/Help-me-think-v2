            "Output": "There are a few things you can do to encourage your child to eat healthy foods. First, make sure that you are providing healthy options for meals and snacks. If your child only has unhealthy food to choose from, she is likely to eat that instead. Try to have a variety of healthy foods available that your child can choose from. You can also try to make healthy food more appealing by adding colors and textures. For example, adding chopped fruit to yogurt or cereal can make it more exciting for your child to eat. You can also try to get your child involved in the cooking process so that she can see how healthy food is made and learn to appreciate the taste of healthy food. Finally, make sure that you are modeling healthy eating habits for your child. If you are eating unhealthy food yourself, your child is more likely to do the same."

There will be an increase in extreme weather events, food and water shortages, and refugee crises as people are displaced due to famine, flooding, and possibly armed conflict motivated by the above.

Depending on the scope of scientific advancement, we will have either discovered new energy sources or greatly improved the efficiency of some of our current ones to keep our world running, or we will break down into a new dark age.

Another suggestion would be to find a good Russian language learning book or online course. Look for one that offers a lot of practice with speaking, listening, and writing. It can also be helpful to find a course that covers grammar in depth. In addition to using a book or course, it is also a good idea to find a Russian tutor or practice speaking with native Russian speakers. This will help you to get accustomed to the sound of the language and to practice using your new skills in a real life setting. Finally, make sure to set aside some time each day to practice speaking and writing Russian. The more you use the language, the better you will become at it."

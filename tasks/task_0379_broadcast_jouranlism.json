But cheetahs are also endangered, with only an estimated 7,500 to 10,000 left in the wild. In this documentary, we'll explore the cheetah's natural habitat, diet, and hunting habits, as well as the threats this magnificent animal faces. We'll also learn about the efforts being made to protect cheetahs and their habitat. So let's take a closer look at the amazing cheetah.\n\nThe scientific name for the cheetah is Acinonyx jubatus. Cheetahs are closely related to jaguars and leopards, and there are four subspecies of cheetah: the Asiatic cheetah, the Iranian cheetah, the Northwest African cheetah, and the South African cheetah. Cheetahs live in Africa and Asia, and they prefer open habitats such as savannas and grasslands.\n\nCheetahs in the wild typically live for 10 to 12 years. They are carnivores, and their diet consists mostly of mammals such as gazelles, impalas, and rabbits. Cheetahs are about the size of a large dog, with males reaching up to six feet in length, including the tail. Females are typically five feet in length. Cheetahs weigh between 60 and 140 pounds.\n\nThe cheetah's top speed is around 70 miles per hour, making it one of the fastest creatures on Earth. Cheetahs typically hunt in short bursts of speed, chasing their prey until it is exhausted.\n\nThe main threats to cheetahs are habitat loss and conflict with humans. As human populations expand, cheetahs are losing the open habitats they need to survive. And as humans and cheetahs come into contact with each other, there is often conflict. Cheetahs are sometimes killed by farmers who see them as a threat to their livestock.\n\nConservation efforts for cheetahs include habitat protection and education programs to reduce conflict with humans. By raising awareness about the plight of the cheetah, we can all help to ensure that this magnificent animal does not become extinct."

Every day, people are killed or injured in accidents because someone was texting while driving.\n\nThe statistics are staggering. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in 2017 alone, 3,166 people were killed in accidents involving a distracted driver. Of those accidents, 9% were caused by drivers who were texting.\n\nAnd it's not just adults. A study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found that nearly one in four high school students admitted to texting while driving.\n\nThese numbers are alarming, but they're not surprising. Just think about how often you see someone texting while driving. It's become so commonplace that we almost don't even think about it.\n\nBut we need to think about it. We need to think about the dangers of texting and driving. We need to think about the accidents and the injuries and the deaths. We need to think about the families who are left to pick up the pieces.\n\nSo please, put down your phone when you're behind the wheel. It can wait. Your life depends on it."

In addition to the rocket itself, it is necessary to build supporting ground equipment, such as the launch pad, control room, and radio communications. Finally, the rocket's onboard computer must be designed and both the flight software and the ground software needs to be coded. All of the project milestones need to go through long testing phases."

The payload will be added after all stages are done. Software will come after hardware, but before integrated testing. Also, the ground station, control room, and communications must be finished before integrated testing. After everything is tested, the launch will occur once the weather and other factors permit."

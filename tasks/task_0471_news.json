                    "Question": "What is the current status?",
                    "Answer": "Despite Russia's reorientation of forces to the east of Ukraine, its offensive has appeared to gain little ground since May. A war of attrition has emerged as big territorial advances have become less frequent, despite Russian forces claiming victory over the city of Lysychansk and overtaking the Luhansk region in early July. Much of the fighting in recent months has been concentrated in eastern and southern pockets of Ukraine around Kharkiv, Severodonetsk and Izyum as well as Mykolaiv, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, where fighting near a nuclear power plant has renewed fears of a possible disaster. Ukrainian forces have tried to take back territory in Kherson, while Russian forces have attempted to advance in Donetsk. Russia's focus is now on the entirety of the Donetsk region in the Donbas, which along with Luhansk was recognised as independent earlier this year. Russian officials have stated that their forces are fighting for the complete liberation of the Donbas."

                    "Question": "What is the background?",
                    "Answer": "The roots of the conflict can be traced back to the 2014 Ukrainian Revolution, when President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in favour of a pro-Western government. This led to Russia's annexation of Crimea, and the start of a pro-Russian insurgency in the Donbas region of Ukraine."

                    "Answer": "Ukraine\u2014which declared itself an independent country in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union\u2014has been forming closer ties with the European Union and with NATO. Russia, however, sees these ties as an economic and strategic threat to its own security."

On 8 April, Russia placed its forces in southern and eastern Ukraine under the command of General Aleksandr Dvornikov, and some units withdrawn from the north were redeployed to the Donbas.

                    "Answer": ":Prospects for the rest of the year and beyond hinge on the questions of whether and when future variants will emerge. As long as Omicron remains the dominant variant, there is reason for relative optimism. Our scenario analysis suggests that Omicron-related hospitalizations are likely to continue to decline in the United States and remain at relatively low levels through the spring and summer (Exhibit 2). We might then expect to see a seasonality-driven wave of disease next fall and winter, but hospitalizations would likely peak well below the level of the wave we just experienced."

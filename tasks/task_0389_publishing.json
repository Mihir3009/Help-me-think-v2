When he was younger, he dreamed of building a robot that could help people in their everyday lives. However, as he got older, he realized that he didn't know as much about AI and math as he needed to make his dream a reality. Ryan was determined to build his robot, so he set out to learn everything he could. He spent hours upon hours in the library, reading everything he could find on the subject. He also took classes and worked with other students who were interested in the same thing. Eventually, after years of hard work, Ryan was able to build his robot. When he showed it to the world, people were amazed. The robot was able to do things that no one had ever thought possible. It was thanks to Ryan's hard work and determination that the world was changed forever."

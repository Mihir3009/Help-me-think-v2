            "Output": " Volcanoes are one of the most dangerous natural disasters. They are capable of causing great damage to life and infrastructure. Volcanoes are also difficult to predict, making it hard to evacuate people in the event of an eruption. The Kilauea volcano is one of the most active volcanoes in Hawaii. It last erupted in September 2021 and is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world. The dangers of the Kilauea volcano include the potential for a large eruption that could cause extensive damage to life and infrastructure. Potentially lethal concentrations of sulfur gas may develop within 1 km in the nearby areas. Active lava flows in the areas of forests can result in methane blasts that might propel boulders and other debris into the air. There are no evacuation plans in place in the event of an eruption. This is because predicting volcanoes is difficult. If you are caught in an eruption, you should use social media to reach out for help. Try to avoid ash, smoke and fire and use a wet piece of cloth to aid respiration."

The volcano poses a great danger to the nearby areas and even the world due to its size. If an eruption were to happen, the falling temperatures could lead to decreased rainfall, failed crops, and mass starvation. There are no evacuation plans currently in place, so people would need to depend on the government to take immediate action."

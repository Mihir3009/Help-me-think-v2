These two species have relatively long lifespans, and they produce a moderate number of offspring per year. In addition, the sex ratio for these two species is relatively even, and they reach sexual maturity at a relatively young age. Therefore, the zoo should focus on captive breeding programs for these two species in order to maintain a healthy and diverse population of animals.",

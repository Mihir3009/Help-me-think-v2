The rash typically appears first on the face, chest, and back and then spreads to the rest of the body. The illness usually lasts for about a week. There is no specific medication to treat chickenpox, but patients can take measures to relieve their symptoms. These include taking over-the-counter pain relievers, applying cool compresses to the rash, and taking baths in lukewarm water. Patients should also drink plenty of fluids and rest as much as possible.",

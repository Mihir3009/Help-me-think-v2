                    "Question": "Why are vaccines important?",
                    "Answer": "Vaccines are important because they help protect people from diseases. Vaccines work by injecting a person with a \u201cdead\u201d or \u201cmodified\u201d form of the virus. As that person's immune system fights off the \u201cdead\u201d virus, the immune system is also preparing to fight the live, or actual, virus. If you are ever exposed to the disease, your immune system is primed and ready to fight it off, because it has done so before."

The Amazon has a long history of human settlement, but in recent decades the pace of change has accelerated due to an increase in human population, the introduction of mechanized agriculture, and the integration of the Amazon region into the global economy. Vast quantities of commodities produced in the Amazon \u2014 cattle beef and leather, timber, soy, oil and gas, and minerals, to name a few \u2014 are exported today to China, Europe, the U.S., Russia, and other countries. This shift has had substantial impacts on Amazon."

In order to strengthen and expand the Green Zone, conservation international will help to consolidate and strengthen the management of existing protected areas and indigenous lands and territories. Additionally, avoid deforestation of large areas of the relatively pristine forest not yet designated for protection. Last but not least, the establishment of new protected areas and indigenous lands and territories and expanding programs that encourage people to protect their forests by giving them economic benefits are also great strategies."

Several tribes of the Jivaroan group, including the Shuar, practiced headhunting for trophies and head shrinking. The accounts of missionaries to the area in the borderlands between Brazil and Venezuela have recounted constant infighting in the Yanomami tribes. More than a third of the Yanomamo males, on average, died from warfare. During the Amazon rubber boom, it is estimated that diseases brought by immigrants, such as typhus and malaria, killed 40,000 native Amazonians."

If the burning of vegetation released all that carbon into the atmosphere, efforts to limit climate change by cutting down on carbon dioxide emissions. All of these species and thousands more could be lost if the Amazon rainforest were to collapse."

Scientists estimate the canyon may have formed 5 to 6 million years ago when the Colorado River began to cut a channel through layers of rock. Humans have inhabited the area in and around the canyon since the last Ice Age. The first Europeans to reach the Grand Canyon were Spanish explorers in the 1540s. President Benjamin Harrison first protected the Grand Canyon in 1893 as a forest reserve, and it became an official United States National Park in 1919."

                    "Answer": "If they keep using the dam operations they\u2019ve been using, we\u2019ll see more erosion of the sandbars in the river corridor that still exists and more vegetation takeover of the parts of those sandbars that aren\u2019t eroded by the flow. There will also be more erosion of archaeological sites. You\u2019ll probably see new debris fans that are bigger than they would have been without the dam because the flows aren\u2019t as big as you need to push some of those rocks downstream. That could make some really exciting new rapids. It will be harder for people to find places to camp. There are tens of thousands of people riding that river corridor every year, and they need places to sleep every night. Some of the most common and most popular camps are on sandbars, and on sand deposits. And those are getting smaller. We will certainly see continued changes in the population dynamics in the fish and aquatic ecosystem and then everything that goes along with it. You change one thing, you change everything else, right? It\u2019s all connected to what happens when you\u2019re in the river down there."

Once you have found a school or instructor, you will need to schedule an appointment for an introductory flight lesson. This will give you a chance to meet the instructor and see if you are comfortable flying with them. It will also give you a chance to ask any questions that you may have about flying.\nAfter your introductory flight lesson, you will need to start taking flying lessons. How often you take lessons will depend on your budget and availability. If you can afford to, you should take at least 2 lessons per week. If you can only afford to take 1 lesson per week, that is okay, you will just need to schedule more lessons in order to reach your goal of becoming a pilot in one year.\nYour flying lessons will cover a variety of topics, including takeoffs, landings, turns, and flying in different types of weather conditions. As you progress, you will also learn how to navigate using maps and instruments.\nIn addition to your flying lessons, you will also need to study for and pass a written exam and a practical exam in order to get your pilot's license.

They will cover topics such as the parts of the airplane, the instruments in the cockpit, and how to control the airplane. After your first lesson, you will have a better idea of what flying is like and what you need to do to progress in your training.\nThe next step in your training plan is to begin learning the basics of flying. You will need to learn how to control the airplane, how to take off and land, and how to navigate. These skills will be taught to you by your CFI during your flying lessons. As you progress in your training, you will learn more advanced skills such as flying in different weather conditions and flying at night.\nYour training plan should also include a schedule for practicing your flying skills. You should set aside time each week to practice what you have learned in your flying lessons."

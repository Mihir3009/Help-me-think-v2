Use a wide angle lens to capture as much of the scene as possible.\n\n3. Set your camera to manual mode so that you have full control over the exposure settings.\n\n4. Set your aperture to its lowest setting (f/2.8) to allow more light into the camera.\n\n5. Set your ISO to a high setting (1600-3200) to ensure that your images are not too dark.\n\n6. Set your shutter speed to a relatively long exposure (15-30 seconds) to capture the stars streaking across the sky.\n\n7. Use the live view mode on your camera to compose your shots and avoid camera shake.\n\n8. Use a remote shutter release or the self-timer function on your camera to avoid camera shake.\n\n9. Experiment with different exposure times to find the perfect balance between star streaking and image brightness."

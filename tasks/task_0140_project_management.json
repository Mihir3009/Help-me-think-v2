The vehicle should be producible in a factory, and should have a base cost under $15,000. Naturally, the vehicle needs to be entirely electric, and should be rechargeable at a standard station or from a home. The vehicle needs to seat at least four people and have additional room for cargo. A minimum of 100,000 vehicles should be produced."

If successful, the project could also result in reducing the cost of electric vehicles, making them more accessible to a wider range of consumers. Also, such a vehicle would be desirable on the market, and could be sold at a high profit.

Production - $100 million\n\nThe research and development team will be responsible for developing the electric vehicle and ensuring that it meets all the requirements. They will have a budget of $100 million. The engineering team will be responsible for designing the factory and ensuring that it is able to mass produce the electric vehicles. They will have a budget of $200 million. The factory construction team will be responsible for building the factory. They will have a budget of $100 million. The production team will be responsible for actually manufacturing the electric vehicles. They will have a budget of $100 million.\n\nThe probability of failure for the project is estimated to be 20%. This probability takes into account the risks associated with the project, such as the possibility that the electric vehicle will not meet the range requirements, that the vehicle will be too expensive to produce, or that the project will not be able to find enough employees with the necessary skills. The important steps necessary to mitigate these risks include having a clear and concise plan for the project, setting realistic goals, and making sure that all stakeholders are on board with the project.\n\nThe timeline for the project is as follows:\n\n1. Research and development - 2 years\n2. Engineering - 1 year\n3. Factory construction - 1 year\n4. Production - 1 year"

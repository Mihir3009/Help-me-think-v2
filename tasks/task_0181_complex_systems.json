The amygdala is responsible for producing the fight-or-flight response, which is characterized by increased heart rate, sweating, and alertness. In individuals with anxiety, the amygdala is hypersensitive and overreacts to stimuli that are not actually threatening. This causes the individual to feel anxious even in situations where there is no real danger. Over time, this can lead to chronic anxiety and anxiety disorders."

I will look at the individual words and try to understand their meaning, and then I will put the words back together to form a complete sentence.

                    "Answer": "I think understanding deals with grasping the underlying concept which I find hard to do when there are long sentences. However, just simply reading a sentence without understanding the information conveyed is not that hard of a task."

Look at the individual words and try to understand their meaning, and then put the words back together to form a complete sentence. You can also try to use context clues to help you understand the meaning of the sentence. If you are having trouble understanding the sentence, you can try reading it aloud or writing it down. Some other strategies that you can use are to look up unfamiliar words, to try to understand the main idea of the sentence, or to paraphrase the sentence in your own words."

                    "Answer": "A long sentence is a sentence that is structurally correct but may be difficult to understand. A run-on sentence is an incorrect sentence because it is two or more independent clauses that are not joined together correctly."

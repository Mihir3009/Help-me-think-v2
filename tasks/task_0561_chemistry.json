This is because the molarity of the solution is 0.5 moles per liter, the volume of the solution is 0.5 liter, and the mass of the compound is 100 grams. The density of the solution is 5 grams per liter, so the compound is not very dense. The boiling point of the solution is 70 degrees Celsius, so the solution is not very hot. The freezing point of the solution is -5 degrees Celsius, so the solution is not very cold. The electrical conductivity of the solution is 3.5 x 10^-6 ohm-1cm-1, so the solution is not very conductive. The solubility of the compound in water is 0.5 gram per liter, so the compound is not very soluble in water. The vapor pressure of the solution is 2.5 atmosphere, so the solution is not very volatile."

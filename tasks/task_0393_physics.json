Then, using the meter stick, measure and mark off a distance of 2 meters from the end of the track. This will be the starting point for the balls.\nNext, we will place two balls at the starting point, one behind the other. The ball in front will be the striker, and the ball in back will be the target. The striker will be given a certain mass, and the target will be given a different mass. The speed of the striker will be varied.\nWe will then observe the collision of the two balls. After the collision, we will measure the distance that the target ball travels. We will repeat this process, varying the mass and the speed.\nWe will be looking for a relationship between the mass and the speed of the balls and the distance that the target ball travels. We expect that the heavier the ball, the shorter the distance it"

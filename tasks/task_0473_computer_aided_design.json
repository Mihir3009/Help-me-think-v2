            "Output": "The first step is to create a basic sketch of the toy train track. This can be done with a pencil and paper, or with a computer-aided design (CAD) program. Once the sketch is complete, it is time to begin creating the track in CAD.For the toy train track, the CAD software of choice would be Autodesk 123D Design. This software is available for free online and is very user-friendly.To begin, create a new project in 123D Design and select the Create Shape tool. Then, use the Rectangle tool to create a rectangle that is the same width and length as the toy train track. Next, use the Bridge tool to create bridges over the track. Finally, use the Tunnel tool to create tunnels under the track.Once the basic shape of the track is complete, it is time to add the details. Begin by adding the trees along the track. To do this, select the Create Shape tool and then the Cylinder tool. Create cylinders that are the same height as the trees and place them along the track.Next, add the model train to the track. To do this, select the Create Shape tool and then the Box tool. Create a box that is the same size as the model train. Place the box on the track and then use the Rotate tool to rotate it so that it is facing the correct direction.Finally, add any other details that are desired, such as signs or lights. Once all of the details have been added, the toy train track is complete!"

These will be the rooms of the dollhouse.6. Place the rooms inside the main body of the dollhouse, spacing them evenly.7. To create the furniture and accessories, use the primitive shapes tools to create basic shapes such as cubes, cylinders, and spheres.8. For the sofa, create two cubes that are 3x3x6 inches. Place them side by side and slightly overlap them.9. For the coffee table, create a cube that is 2x2x2 inches.10. For the chairs, create two cylinders that are 3x3x6 inches. Place them facing each other.11. For the kitchen table, create a cube that is 4x4x2 inches.12. For the bed, create a rectangle that is 6x3x2 inches.13. For the dresser, create a cube that is 3x3x6 inches.14. For the changing table, create a cube that is 2x2x2 inches.15. For the crib, create a rectangle that is 3x3x2 inches.16.

Once you have a three-dimensional model of the toy, you can begin to create detailed drawings and plans. This can be done using a computer program such as AutoCAD.5. Once you have detailed drawings and plans, you can begin to create a prototype of the toy. This can be done using a 3D printer or by hand.6. Once you have a prototype of the toy, you can begin to test it. This can involve flying the toy, testing the remote control, and attaching the camera.7. Once you have tested the toy and are happy with the results, you can begin to mass produce the toy."

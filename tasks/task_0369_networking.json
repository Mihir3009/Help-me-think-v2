            "Output": "Salesmen often struggle with networking because they either don't know how many people they should know or they are too shy to start a conversation. However, networking is a critical part of business, especially for salesmen. It allows them to build relationships with potential customers and clients, as well as other professionals who can help them grow their business. The first step to being a successful networker is understanding how many people you should know. While it may seem like the more, the better, it's actually quality over quantity. It's more important to have a few close connections that you can rely on, rather than a large number of acquaintances. When it comes to starting a conversation, the best salesmen are the ones who are prepared. They have an elevator pitch about their business ready to go, and they make sure to bring plenty of business cards and other marketing materials. If you're not sure what to say, some conversation starters include asking about the other person's business, what brought them to the event, or any common interests you may have. "

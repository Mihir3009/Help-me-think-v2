Whales are very important to the health of the earth's oceans. They help to keep the oceans clean by eating large amounts of plankton and other small creatures. They also help to regulate the temperature of the oceans by releasing warm water from their Blowholes. We can help save whales by reducing pollution, stopping hunting them, and by helping to prevent them from getting entangled in fishing gear. We can also support organizations that are working to protect whales and their habitat. The time to act is now. We must do everything we can to save these magnificent creatures before it's too late."

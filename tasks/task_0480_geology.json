From the above information, it can be concluded that the rocks in the area are strong enough to support the tunnel without any major problems. There is a moderate amount of water in the rocks, which could potentially pose a problem during construction, but should not pose a major problem. There are no jointed rocks in the area, which is good news for the construction of the tunnel."

The Young's modulus is 15GPa and the Poisson's ratio is 0.7. The length of the tunnel is 120m. The geological conditions are generally good for the construction of the tunnel. The main factor to consider is the water pressure, which is high, but the rocks are strong enough to support it. There are some joints in the rocks, but they are not systematic, so they should not pose a significant problem."

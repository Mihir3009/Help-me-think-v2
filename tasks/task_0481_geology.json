The sedimentary rock in the region is of good quality for drilling, and the average temperature and rainfall are favourable for oil production. The depth of the rock is also favourable for drilling, and the porosity and permeability of the rock are both good for petroleum production. The only potential concern is the low salinity of the water in the region, which could indicate a lack of oil in the area. However, overall, the evidence suggests that there is a good chance of finding petroleum in the region."

The current treatment options for azoospermia are either extremely expensive or invasive, with a low success rate. However, there is hope that stem cells could be used in regenerative transplants to treat this condition.\n\nThe purpose of our research is to investigate the feasibility of using stem cells in regenerative transplants to treat male patients with infertility due to absence of spermatogonial stem cells. We are using various methods to conduct our research, including literature review, cell culture experiments, and animal studies.\n\nSo far, our findings have shown that by introducing human iPSC cells in mice testicles there is restoration of spermatogenesis. This could mean the end of azoospermia, the medical condition of a man whose semen contains no sperm. We plan to continue to investigate the efficacy of the restoration process and improve the cell culture techniques related to this particular case.\n\nMethods:\n\nWe are using various methods to conduct our research, including literature review, cell culture experiments, and animal studies.\n\nFor our literature review, we are looking at previous research on stem cells, regenerative transplants, and azoospermia. We are also conducting cell culture experiments to study the feasibility of using stem cells in regenerative transplants. Finally, we are conducting animal studies to investigate the efficacy of the restoration process.\n\nFindings:\n\nSo far, our findings have shown that by introducing human iPSC cells in mice testicles there is restoration of spermatogenesis. This could mean the end of azoospermia, the medical condition of a man whose semen contains no sperm.\n\nFuture Goals:\n\nThe next steps for this research is to investigate the efficacy of the restoration process in human test subjects. We plan to study the sperm counts and their survival rates from mice testicles. Our long-term goal is to successfully transplant the cultured stem cells and effectively treat the medical conditions associated with male fertility.\n\nReferences:\n\nLee, J.Y., Choi, Y., & Xu, J.

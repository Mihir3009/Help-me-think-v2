So, he began to study physics. He read about all of the different forces that act on objects, like gravity. He was fascinated by how gravity could make things fall down, even though they seemed to be pulled up. The boy experimented with different objects to see how gravity affected them. He found that the heavier an object was, the more gravity it had. And the more gravity an object had, the faster it would fall."

But I like to think that there are happy stories out there too, about planets that find a way to be together despite the odds."

He begins to investigate and soon discovers that the strange lights and noises are coming from a nearby physics laboratory.\nJohn goes to the laboratory and speaks to the scientist who runs it. The scientist explains that he is experimenting with electricity and that he is creating electromagnetic waves. He assures John that he is not doing anything dangerous and that the town has nothing to worry about.\nThe scientist's explanation satisfies John and he goes back to the town to tell the people what he has learned. The townspeople are relieved and the mystery is solved."

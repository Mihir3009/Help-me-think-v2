            "Output": "Assuming you would like a detailed plan: \n\nFirst, head outside to your rooftop at around 12 am. It's important to give your eyes 30 minutes to adjust to the darkness, so try to avoid using any bright lights during this time. If you have a red light, that's even better, as it won't disrupt your night vision as much. \n\nOnce it's nice and dark, take a look around and see what's visible. If you're not familiar with the night sky, it might be helpful to use a star chart to help you find your way around. \n\nSome good things to start with are the constellations. Pick out a few of the most prominent ones and see if you can find them in the sky. Once you've found them, see if you can find some of the stars that make up those constellations. \n\nFrom there, see if you can find some of the other bright objects in the night sky. The moon, for example, is usually quite easy to spot. Jupiter and Saturn are also usually visible to the naked eye, although they might require a little bit of searching to find. \n\nIf you have a telescope, now is the time to set it up. Start with some of the easier objects to find, like the moon or some of the brighter planets. Once you've found them, see if you can use your telescope to get a closer look. See if you can spot any of the features that you would normally be able to see with binoculars or a small telescope. \n\nAfter you've spent some time looking at some of the easier objects, see if you can find some of the more challenging ones. The supernova, for example, might be a little bit more difficult to find. But if you know where to look, you should be able to spot it. The same goes for galaxies. They're usually not as bright as some of the other objects in the night sky, but they can be just as interesting to look at.",

First, the question assumes that there is an average lifespan for all humans, when in reality there is a large range of lifespans due to different factors such as genetics, lifestyle, and location. Second, the question uses the word average without defining what this means, which could be interpreted in different ways. Third, the answer to the question gives a specific number without any context or explanation, which makes it difficult to know if this is accurate or not. Finally, the question and answer both assume that all humans live in the same conditions, when in fact there are many different factors that can affect lifespan."

Another fallacy is that the average lifespan of a human in the world is 10 years for men and women of different ages and gender. This is a fallacy because it is only taking into account the average lifespan of a human in one continent."

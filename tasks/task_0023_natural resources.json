        "Output": "Dear Board, I am writing to submit a proposal that the university shift to solar power in order to save money and reduce emissions. As you are aware, the university spends $2 million on energy costs each year. The vast majority of this cost is for electricity, which currently comes from natural gas. However, there are now more affordable and environmentally friendly options available, namely wind and solar power. The estimated cost of shifting to solar power is $3 million. This may seem like a lot of money, but it is important to consider the long-term savings and benefits. Solar power is renewable and will save the university $0.5 million per year in energy costs. In addition, solar power will help the university reduce its carbon emissions by 3,000 metric tons per year, and reduce water usage by 0.5 million gallons per year. Shifting to solar power is the best option for the university in terms of cost savings, emissions reductions, and water usage. I therefore urge you to consider this proposal and approve the shift to solar power. Thank you for your time and consideration."

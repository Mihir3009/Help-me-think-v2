After that, filming can start using the actors. Scenes may need to be refilmed, and then editing can commence. Finally, the movie needs to be marketed and distributed to theaters and streaming platforms.\n\nThe order of tasks is important, because if the screenplays are not written, then there would be no movie to film. The employees who should do each task are also important. For example, the writers should write the screenplays, the set and prop designers should design the sets and props, and the cinematographers should film the movie.\n\nThe budget should be managed and divided between tasks so that the most important tasks are given the most money. For example, the screenplays should be given a large budget so that they are well-written, and the cinematographers should be given a large budget so that they can film the movie well.\n\nThe timeline for the project is one year. This is because it takes a long time to write, film, and edit a movie.\n\nThe probability of failure is high, because making a movie is a risky endeavor. However, there are important steps that can be taken to mitigate risks. For example, the screenplays should be well-written, and the movie should be well-made and well-edited. Additionally, the movie should be marketed well so that people know about it and want to see it."

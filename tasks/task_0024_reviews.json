The atmosphere was pretty standard for a McDonald's. However, I was too busy trying to keep my daughter from getting sick to really enjoy it. I would recommend this restaurant to others, but I would also recommend that they avoid the ball pit. The bathrooms looked like a warzone and I think I might have PTSD now."

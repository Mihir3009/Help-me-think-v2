It is possible that there are higher forms of life, but the conditions on the planet are not conducive to complex life forms. The average surface temperature and atmospheric composition make it unlikely that there are any land-based creatures on this planet. The lack of an atmosphere and the high surface gravity make it unlikely that there are any flying creatures. The most likely forms of alien life on this planet are single-celled organisms that live in the oceans.\n\nNASA might identify this life by looking for chemical signatures in the atmosphere or in the oceans. They might also look for heat signatures from hydrothermal vents. If there are higher forms of life on this planet, they are most likely to be found near hydrothermal vents."

The planet has liquid water below the surface, and possibly has geothermal vents.\n\n Given the information above, it is hypothesized that the alien planet supports life in some form. The most likely candidates for this are microbial lifeforms, given the extreme conditions on the planet. However, it is also possible that more complex lifeforms exist in sheltered environments, such as underground caves or near geothermal vents. In order to identify life on the planet, NASA would need to send a probe to collect samples of the atmosphere, surface, and subsurface. These samples would then be analyzed for signs of life, such as DNA, proteins, or other biomolecules. If signs of life are found, further study would be needed to determine the type of life present on the planet."

The main difference would be in the temperature range, atmospheric pressure, atmospheric composition, and surface gravity, which would all be adapted to the conditions on the planet. For example, if the planet has a very high surface gravity, then the life forms would likely be very large and dense in order to be able to support their own weight. If the planet has a very low surface gravity, then the life forms would likely be very small and lightweight in order to be able to float or fly in the planet's atmosphere. If the planet has a very high surface temperature, then the life forms would likely be very heat-resistant in order to be able to survive in the hot conditions. If the planet has a very low surface temperature, then the life forms would likely be very cold-resistant in order to be able to survive in the cold conditions."

            "Output": "To generate a computer-aided design for the cabinets, you will need to use a software program that allows you to create three-dimensional models. Some popular software programs for this purpose include SketchUp, AutoCAD, and 3ds Max.When creating the design, you will need to take into account the size, style, color, and material of the cabinets, as well as the type of hardware and finish you want.To create a modern-style cabinet, you will likely want to use clean lines and simple shapes. For the color, you can either use a brown stain or paint the cabinets a solid brown color.The size of the cabinets will need to be 35 inches wide. If you want the cabinets to be hung on the wall, you will need to take into account the height of the ceiling and the distance between the floor and the ceiling when determining the height of the cabinets.If you want the cabinets to have doors, you will need to decide on the type of door you want and whether or not you want glass inserts. For the shelves, you will need to decide how many shelves you want and what type of material you want them to be made out of.For the hardware, you will need to choose handles that coordinate with the style of the cabinets. If you want the cabinets to be painted, you will need to choose a paint color that coordinates with the color of the cabinets."

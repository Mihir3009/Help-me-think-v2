The environmental impacts of volcanic ash can be significant, especially if the eruption is large. The ash can cause damage to crops, trees, and water supplies. It can also cause power outages and transportation disruptions. The economic impacts of volcanic ash can be far-reaching, as the ash can affect climate and farm production on a global scale. Volcanic ash is still a hazard, even after the eruption has occurred, as the particles can still cause health problems if inhaled or made contact with."

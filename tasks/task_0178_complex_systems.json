While the current environment is favorable for gold, a number of factors could weigh on the precious metal. These include the overall health of the economy, investor confidence, and the tweets of Elon Musk. As such, predicting an exact price point for gold two months from now is difficult. However, those looking to invest in gold should do so with caution and be prepared for a volatile ride."

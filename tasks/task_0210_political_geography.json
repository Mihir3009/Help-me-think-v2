To do this, start with your feet together and then take a small step to the right with your right foot. Then, follow by taking a small step to the left with your left foot. Repeat this pattern, moving your feet to the right and then to the left. 2. Once you have the basic two-step down, you can start to add in some arm movements. For this step, lift your arms up so that they are parallel to the ground. As you move your feet from side to side, sway your arms from side to side as well. 3. The next step is to add in a hip movement. As you move your feet from side to side, shift your hips so that they are also moving from side to side. 4. To add even more movement, you can start to clap your hands as you move your feet and hips from side to side. 5. Finally, you can add in some turns. As you move your feet and hips from side to side, turn your body so that you are facing the opposite direction. Then, reverse the turn and face the original direction."

If carbon-based life is not the only type of life in the universe, it is possible that a shadow biosphere of non-carbon based life exists on Earth. This shadow biosphere could be composed of silicon-based life forms that use methane as a solvent. If such life forms exist, they would be difficult to detect because they would be chemically distinct from carbon-based life. However, if they do exist, they could have a significant impact on the methane cycle on Earth."

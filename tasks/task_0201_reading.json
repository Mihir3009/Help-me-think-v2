This will help you to gauge their baseline reading skills and set reading goals accordingly.\n2. Next, introduce your students to the basic concepts of reading via fun and interactive activities. This could include singing alphabet songs, acting out stories, and playing games.\n3. Once your students have a solid foundation, begin teaching them phonemic awareness, phonics, and sight words. These strategies will help them to decode words and become more fluent readers.\n4. Encourage your students to practice reading at home by setting up a reward system. For example, every time they read 10 pages, they get to choose a small prize from a treasure box.\n5. Finally, create a positive learning environment in your classroom by making reading fun and interactive. Use audio visual technologies to help bring the stories to life and keep your students engaged."

It is clear that people experience a wide range of emotions, from happiness and excitement to sadness and anxiety. What makes people feel these emotions varies from individual to individual, but there are some common themes. For example, many people feel happy when they are around loved ones, when they are experiencing new things, or when they are achieving something. On the other hand, people often feel sad when they see others suffering, when they are reminded of global conflict, or when they feel like they can't make a difference in the world. These answers provide a snapshot of the complex emotional lives of humans, and highlight the importance of experiences, relationships, and self-perception in shaping our emotions."

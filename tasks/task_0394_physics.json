This is especially important for topics that you find more difficult. When it comes to the electric circuits exam, make sure you are comfortable with Ohm's law, DC circuits, and Kirchhoff's rules.\nOhm's Law:\n-Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the potential difference across the two points.\n-This can be written as I=V/R, where I is the current, V is the voltage, and R is the resistance.\n-You can use a graph to determine the relationship between current and voltage for a given resistor.\nDC Circuits:\n-A DC circuit is a circuit in which the current always flows in the same direction.\n-The current in a DC circuit is determined by the voltage and the resistance.\n-You can use Ohm's law to calculate the current in a DC circuit.\n-Kirchhoff's rules can be used to solve for the unknown voltage or current in a DC circuit.\nKirchhoff's Rules"

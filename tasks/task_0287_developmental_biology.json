Stem cells are cells that have the ability to self-renew or divide indefinitely, as well as differentiate into specialized cell types. Stem cells are responsible for generating new cells during growth and repair. There are two types of stem cells: embryonic stem cells, which are derived from early-stage embryos, and adult stem cells, which are found in fully-developed organisms."

One of the main risks is that of rejection, where the body's immune system rejects the transplanted cells. There is also a risk of the cells becoming cancerous, and of the treatment itself causing damage to healthy tissue."

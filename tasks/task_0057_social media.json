I was really impressed with how quickly they made my food, considering I asked them to hold the onions. Overall, I had a great experience at McDonald's and would definitely recommend it to others. The food is great, the service is wonderful, and the wait time is minimal. Thank you, McDonald's, for a great experience!"

Thanks, McDonald's, for a great experience! Additionally, the place was jam packed and there were a lot of customers justifying the quality of food and service provided by McDonald's. I would like to visit the kitchen of a branch someday."

I also really appreciate how accommodating the employees are - they made my burger without onions even though I didn't ask for it until I was already at the register. Additionally, I didn't want any ice in my coke which they accounted for."

                    "Answer": "Yes, the service was good, the food was good, but the place was not that clean which made me rethink about visiting there again. I think it is dependent on the branch specifically."

I think I would go in and see if the branch is clean. If it is, then I will go in and grab something to eat. Also, I would like to try other things on the menu as well."

It was burnt and since I ordered a vegetarian sub, a burnt sub was the last thing I needed. The avocado was old and the lettuce was wilted.

Although, I would like to add that the restrooms should be cleaner than how I found them. But it's not really their fault as people come in all the time and use the restroom. They cannot be cleaning it everytime someone uses the restroom."

            "Output": "The Mongol Empire had a significant impact on the development of both China and Japan. In terms of human geography, the empire helped to shape the way these nations developed by introducing new ideas and technologies. For example, prior to the Mongols\u2019 arrival in East Asia, China was far more advanced than Japan in terms of its level of economic development and technological innovation. However, after exposure to Mongolian culture and technology through trade and conquest, Japanese society began to rapidly catch up with (and eventually surpass) their Chinese counterparts. The influence of the Mongol Empire can also be seen in other areas such as religion \u2013 for instance, Buddhism became more widespread in Japan due largely to contact with Buddhist missionaries from Mongolia during this period. Ultimately, the legacy of the Mongol Empire has been highly positive for both China and Japan; without this outside influence neither nation would likely have achieved such high levels of cultural or technological advancement."

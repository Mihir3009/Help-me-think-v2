To create a computer-aided design for the floor plan, first open up a software program that allows you to create two-dimensional designs, such as AutoCAD, SketchUp, or Revit. 2. Begin by creating a basic outline of the rooms, including the living room, kitchen, and bedroom. Make sure to leave enough space in between each room for doorways and hallways. 3. Once the basic layout is complete, begin adding in furniture and other features. For the living room, add in a couch, coffee table, TV, and dining table with chairs. For the kitchen, add in cabinets, countertops, appliances, and a sink. 4. For the bedroom, add in a bed, dresser, and nightstand. 5. Once all of the furniture and features are in place, add in doors and windows. 6. Finally, add in any finishing touches, such as paint colors, flooring, and light fixtures."

There are many different software programs that you can use for this purpose, but we recommend using AutoCAD. Once you have opened AutoCAD, you will need to create a new drawing. To do this, click on the File menu and then select New. In the New Drawing window, select the Architectural template and then click OK. Once the new drawing has been created, you will need to add the dimensions of the room. To do this, click on the Dimensions tool and then click on two points in the drawing area to specify the length and width of the room. Next, you will need to add the furniture to the floor plan. To do this, click on the Furniture tool and then select the pieces of furniture that you want to add to the floor plan. Once you have added all of the furniture, you will need to arrange it in the floor plan. To do this, click on the Arrange tool and then click and drag the pieces of furniture into the desired position. Finally, you will need to add the appliances to the floor plan. To do this, click on the Appliances tool and then select the appliances that you want to add to the floor plan. Once you have added all of the appliances, you will need to connect them to the power outlets. To do this, click on the Electrical tool and then click and drag the electrical wires to the desired position. Once you have finished creating the floor plan, you will need to save it. To do this, click on the File menu and then select Save As. In the Save Drawing window, select the location where you want to save the file and then click OK."

When using AutoCAD, start by opening a new file and setting the units to feet. Then, draw the outline of the space using the rectangle tool. For the dimensions of the space, use the measurements provided in the question and answer.  Once the outline of the space is drawn, add in the doors and windows. For the doors, use the door tool and for the windows, use the window tool.  After the doors and windows are added, start drawing the walls. For the walls, use the line tool. Remember to add in the door and window openings.  Once the walls are drawn, start adding in the rooms. For the bedrooms, use the rectangle tool and for the living room, use the polygon tool. For the dining room, use the circle tool.  After the rooms are added, start adding in the furniture. For the furniture, use the rectangle tool. Remember to add in the door and window openings.  Finally, add in the details. For the details, use the line tool."
